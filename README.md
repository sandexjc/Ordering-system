Login && Home
- The system is initially designed to be used only by private group of people which makes the login necessary.
- First account should be created by the terminal as superuser/admin in order to be able to login into the web interface and create additional accounts.
- Once logged in you will land on the home page where you will be able to find the nav bar with account settings, user management and home page button.

- Orders state can be easily managed by clicking on the update button. Modal window with predefined states will be opened and updating the state will not trigger window closure due to usage of AJAX requests.
